# My talk on Modern CSS Architecture, 2024 and forward.

CSS has been under rapid development for the past few years. With new powerful features being added every week, it is only a matter of time before our old methods would become completely obsolete and unique design patterns would emerge and take over to replace the old.

## Debriefing:

#### What is the "Elevator Pitch" for this talk (300 characters or less)?

Modern CSS Architecture 2024 — A Primer on Infusing Intriniscality into User Interfaces | Marvin Danig | Dulles Code & Coffee

#### Who is the ideal audience? E.g., What domains? Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced? 

Domain: Frontend. Ideal Audience: Beginners to Intermediate.

From Container-Queries to Native Nesting, from CSS Scopes to Cascade Layers, from Color-Schemes and CSS Accents to Pretty and Balanced Text Formatting—it is all happening simultaneously and fast. 

In this talk, we look at where we are with the existing ideals of Responsive Web Design and where we are likely headed with the many new capabilities of CSS that allow us to customize and deliver the most ideal and _intrinsically suitable_ user experience to the end-user.
